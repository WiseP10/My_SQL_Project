# Background
This project involves analyzing a dataset comprising various data job postings and their associated salaries and skills. It's born from a desire to pinpont top-paid and in-demand skill.

Data hails from my [SQL course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql).It's packed with insights on job titel, salaries , location , and essential skills.

### The Question I want to answer through my SQL quries were.

1. What are the top-paying job?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying job?
3. What skill are most in demand for data analyst?
4. Which skill are associate with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skill to learn? 
# Tools I Used
- SQL
- PostgreSQL
- Power BI
- Git & GitHub
# The Analyst
#### 1. What are the top-paying job?
- To find the highest-paying roles, I looked at data analyst jobs by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote positions that you can work from anywhere. This shows the best-paying opportunities in the field.
```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name as company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg desc
LIMIT 10
```
By using this SQL queries we found that.
- **Wide Salary Range**: Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000,    indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers**: Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety**: There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. What skills are required for these top-paying job?
- From the first question we already known the top-paying job. To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_job AS ( 
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,    
        salary_year_avg,
        name as company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg desc
    LIMIT 10)

    SELECT 
        top_paying_job.*,
        skills
    FROM top_paying_job
    JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_job.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    JOIN skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    ORDER BY 
        salary_year_avg DESC
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:

- SQL is leading with a bold count of 8.
- Python follows closely with a bold count of 7.
- Tableau is also highly sought after, with a bold count of 6. Other skills like R, Snowflake, Pandas, and Excel show varying degrees of demand.

### 3. What skill are most in demand for data analyst?
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.Focus only top 5 skills.
```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    count(skills_job_dim.job_id) as demand_count
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
    JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    JOIN skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY skills
order by 
    demand_count DESC
limit 5
```
- SQL and Excel remain fundamental, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.
- Programming and Visualization Tools like Python, Tableau, and Power BI are essential, pointing towards the increasing importance of technical skills in data storytelling and decision support.

### 4. Which skill are associate with higher salaries?
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.
```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    round(avg(salary_year_avg),0) as avg_salary
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
    JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    JOIN skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY skills
order by 
    avg_salary DESC

limit 10
```
